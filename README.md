# Stormhacks-Huawei-Challenge-2
## Inspiration
It seemed like an interesting challenge that would be fun to take on together.

## What it does
Returns a vector of nodes that is in near optimal order for minimizing time.

## How we built it
We used c++ and an advanced heuristic algorithm.

## Challenges we ran into
Long runtime to compute a still valid solution.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are able to make an algorithm that returns a good solution to the problem.

## What we learned
We learned teamwork, how to split tasks for complicated algorithms, and more c++ knowledge.

## What's next for Hooray-For-Huawei
We'd love to get advice to learn how we could improve our algorithm. We had tons of fun making it, and would love to continue.
